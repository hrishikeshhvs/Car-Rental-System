## 1. Project Overview

The **Car Rental System** is a full-stack web application that allows users to **rent cars** and **list their own cars for rent**. The platform ensures secure transactions, proper tracking of rentals, and damage reporting. Admins manage approvals, monitor users, and generate system reports.

The system is built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. It uses **JWT authentication** for security and **JPA ORM** for database operations.
